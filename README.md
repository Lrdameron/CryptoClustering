# Crypto Clustering

## Overview

#### The Crypto Clustering notebook performs clustering analysis on cryptocurrency data to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies based on key market metrics. This can be useful for understanding market trends, segmenting assets, and informing investment strategies.

### Features

###### Data Preprocessing: Loads and cleans cryptocurrency market data.

###### Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for clustering.

###### Standardization: Applies scaling to ensure uniformity in data.

###### Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce data complexity.

###### Clustering Algorithms: Implements K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies.

###### Visualization: Generates scatter plots and other visualizations to analyze cluster distributions.

### Dependencies

#### The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

###### pandas

###### numpy

###### matplotlib

###### seaborn

###### scikit-learn

### Results & Insights

#### PCA visualization indicates stronger clustering due to lower inertia.

###### Stronger clustering results can provide clearer insights into potential market behavior and asset similarities.

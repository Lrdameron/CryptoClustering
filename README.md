Crypto Clustering

Overview

The Crypto Clustering notebook performs clustering analysis on cryptocurrency data to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies based on key market metrics. This can be useful for understanding market trends, segmenting assets, and informing investment strategies.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Loads and cleans cryptocurrency market data.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for clustering.

Standardization: Applies scaling to ensure uniformity in data.

Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce data complexity.

Clustering Algorithms: Implements K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies.

Visualization: Generates scatter plots and other visualizations to analyze cluster distributions.

Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

To install missing dependencies, run:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage

Load the Notebook: Open Crypto_Clustering.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Run the Cells: Execute each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, perform clustering, and visualize the results.

Interpret Results: Review the generated clusters and visualizations to understand market segmentation.

Results & Insights

The notebook identifies distinct clusters of cryptocurrencies based on selected features.

PCA helps in visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.

Clustering results provide insights into potential market behavior and asset similarities.

Future Enhancements

Experimenting with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).

Incorporating additional features like trading volume and sentiment analysis.

Automating data fetching from live sources for real-time analysis.
